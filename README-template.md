## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)



### What I learned

The use of ui material to speed up the design and not to worry so much about the style pattern. It is completely configurable and will follow the pattern on its own.

### Continued development

React router has always been a great help, but I would like to go deeper into the use of location params.


### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

You can use the <Routes /> component of react router in the place where you want to deploy the component, it is not necessary to use the <outlet /> component, this way it is easier to nest pages.
